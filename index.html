		<p>My name is Ashiqul Islam, my father’s name is Safiqul Islam and my mother’s name is Asma Begum. I was born on 15 March 1988 in Kamargaon of Narsingdi. My father was an army officer and now he is a businessman. I have one brother and one sister. I started my primary education from Putia High School. Then I was admitted to Noyadia Khaisakhaly Madrashah. I have completed Dakhil from there in 2005. Later on I was admitted to Narsingdi Government College. I have completed my Higher Secondary education from there in 2007. In 2008 I have got the chance in Jagannath University in English. I have completed my honours in English in 2013 and masters in 2015. I like reading books, swimming and travelling.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">My Family Members</span></strong>:</span> I was born and brought up in middle class family. My family is an extended family. My family members are eight in numbers. I have a brother and a sister. My brother’s name is Rashedul Islam. He completed BBA from a well reputed private university. Now he is a merchandising manager in a buying house. He is married and has two children. His children’s name is Shajedul Islam Labib and Nafisa Islam Rounak. They study in class one and nursery respectively. My father was an army officer. His rank was Senior Warrant Officer. At present he is a retired person and a businessman. My mother is a homemaker. My sister’s name is Shahida Islam Tamanna. She completed her honors from Gono University in Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering. She is married and her husband works in Bangladesh Air force as a Corporal.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>My Childhood</strong>:</span> I was born in a middle class family. My father was a soldier who stayed in Chittagong. I spent five to six years in my village home. Than we shifted to my father work place Chittagong Cantonment. There we stayed for about three years. Then my father posted to Mymensing Cantonment and we shifted to our village home. After one year my father posted to Comilla cantonment and we again shifted to Comilla cantonment. Here we stayed for 2 years and then my father was posted to Rangpur cantonment. We stayed some years there. In the year 1998 my father was posted to Saidpur cantonment and we also shifted there. We stayed there until 2004.I spent my childhood life not in a specific place but in different cantonments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Childhood Education:</span></strong> My parents wanted me to become a hafiz-e- quran. That is why they get me admitted to a hafizi madrasah called Tri Mohoni Darul Quran Madrasah which is situated one kilometer away from our locality. We the group of children used to go to the Madrasah at dawn and used to come back at 10:30. After some days I was admitted to this madrasah for 24 hours and I have to stay there for day and night. At that time I was a child of 5 to 6 years. My body was confined in madrasah but my mind and soul was confined at home in front of the television set. I was very much fond of Alif Laila. At the time of Alif Laila the teacher used to guard us so that we cannot watch TV. At that time I had only two ways open for me: one is Alif Laila and another one is madrasah. So I choose the 1<sup>st</sup> one and started escaping from the madrasah. My mom sent me to go to madrasah and I used to pass time climbing the trees. My parents got myself admitted to a madrasah called Mirjanagor Madrasah which is situated at Mirjanagor, Narsingdi. It is almost twenty kilometers away from our locality. Here I lead a lonely and isolated life. My body was in madrasah but my mind was at our home. Again I started escaping from the madrasah. My mother used to go to my madrasah to visit me. My mother used to return home by boat and I also return home on following boat. It continued for a long time. Than my parents take me back from this madrasah and got myself admitted to a madrasah called Sahe Portab Madrasah. Here I study four to five month. Than I was admitted to a madrasah called Mathichor Qoumia Madrasah.  Here I studied almost three year. The principal of this madrasah was my uncle and there was lots of children of our village. My father was posted to Saidpur cantonment and I was admitted to Saidpur Darul Ulum Madrasah. Here I finished my childhood education.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Some Childhood Memories:</span></strong> I with my childhood friends used to play different types of games. Our popular game was hide and seek. We would play this game at night. One of them would count 1234…. And the other would hide. While playing the game we would sing the song like this:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The grass is green, the rose is red</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Remember me when I am dead dead dead</span></strong>…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other important games were gullachoot, darichabandha, Bouchee etc. At the time of eid we used to wear new cloths. We the children had a criteria to measure the superiority of our cloths and that is ‘the deeper the pocket, the better the cloth’. One of our interesting pastime is to jump from the tree into the river. One day one of my friends climbed on the tree wearing Panjabi and pajama to jump into the river. When he jumped, his Panjabi got attached to the branches of the tree. He was hanging with the tree and asking for the help. That was some of my childhood memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">My Hobbies:</span></strong> Everybody has hobbies that he does during his leisure time. I have also lots of hobbies. I like to travel during my leisure time. During the two eid holidays I with my fiends go outside to see the beautiful creation of almighty Allah. I am fond of both hills and the sea. During the past few eid holidays we went to Nilgiri, Nilachol, Chimbuk hill, Thanchi and other places of Bandarban. I went to Cox’s Bazar sea beach twice. At the end of 2018 we went to Saint Martine Island and Chera Dwip. It was our memorable travel experience. My another hobby is reading books. Recently I have completed reading the translation of holy Quran. It fulfills my unquenchable thirst for knowledge and experience. My other hobby is swimming. In the Dhaka city there is no scope of swimming. When I go to our village home, I never missed the opportunity to swim. In my leisure time I also visit Islamic documentary on youtube. Especially I visit travel videos in youtube.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">My Educational Background:</span></strong> I have completed my Dakhil examination from Noyadia Khaisakhali Madrasah. Basically my madrasah education continues in different madrasahs. My father’s posting was in the different parts of Bangladesh and I also studied in different part of Bangladesh. For example, my father was posted to Comilla and I got admission in Comilla Gondhomoti Madrasah. My father posted to Saidpur, Nilphamari and I was admitted to Saidpur Darul Ulum Madrasah. In 2005 I passed the Dakhil examination from Noyadia Khasakhali Madrasah. I got GPA 3.67 out of 5. I took admission in Narsingdi Government College in the year 2005. At that time our family was staying in Bilashdi, Narsingdi on rent. It was situated in Narsingdi Sadar. I would attend the class using my bicycle. Here I would like to mention that my group was humanities or arts in both Dakhil and Higher Secondary education. My favorite Teacher was Rabiul Alam Sir who was the lecturer in English in Narsingdi Government College. Another favourite teacher was Asheq Mahmood Khan. He was my private tutor. His always follows his guideline. I have completed my Higher Secondary Examination in 2007 and my GPA was 3.70. Thus my important phase of my education life completed. Now I have to start a new warfare called university admission war. At first I could not decide which coaching center would be better for me. My elder brother suggested me to get admission in UCC coaching center situated in Faram Gate. So I got admission there. I travelled from Narsingdi to Faram Gate three to four days in a week. I would finish the lecture sheet provided by the UCC sitting on the bus. Because I have to stay in the bus for 2 to 2.5 hours in a day. Three months I studied 10 hours in an average. At first I attended the admission test in Rajshahi University. One of my uncles studied in Rajshahi University. He studied in history. I stayed with my uncle and attended the admission test. I have to stay there for one week. I have to attend the written test there. When the result published, I found that I did not get the chance there. The reason of my failure was that I was not prepared for the written test but I was prepared for the MCQ test. Then I attended the Jahangir Nagar admission test. I stayed there with one of my friends. In this test I did not get any success because of the same reason. ThanI attended admission test in Shahjalal University in Sylhet. I went to Sylhet by bus and the bus reached to Sylhet at 3:00 am. It was severe cold there. I stayed in the holy shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal ®. In the morning I attended the admission test and it was a huge success. My merit list position was 250. My warfare did not stop here. I attended the admission test in Chittagong University and my merit list position was around 900. So I got myself admitted in the Shahjalal University in political studies. Here a memorable incident took place. When I attended the viva voce at Shahjalal University, I met with renowned science fiction writer Jafar Iqbal. He was in the viva board. I got admitted there but my fighting continues. I attended the admission test in Jagannath University and my merit list position is 685. I got the chance in English there. On the other hand I attended the first mid semester examination in Sahjalal University. Then I cancelled the admission in Sahjalal University and took admission in Jagannath University in English. It was a hardest battle I have ever fought in my life indeed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">My University Life:</span></strong> University Life was the best moments of my whole life. I got admission in Jagannath University in the year 2008. Our session was 2007-08. The number of the students in our class was around 100. I was in the 3<sup>rd</sup> batch. I travel every day from Narsingdi to Sadaghat or Jagannath University. It takes around two hours to reach to the university. My travelling from Narsingdi to Jagannath University continues for about two years. The well-known business man Abdul Kadir Mullah of Narsingdi donate a bus to Jagannath University on the request of Narsingdi students. As a result our suffering reduces to some extent. The name of the bus was Nongor. Some of my favourite university teachers are Mominul Haque, Tanvir Ahmed, Mamunul Haque, Jafor Ahmed. There was a teacher who was famous for his heretic lectures and writings. His name is Nasiruddin Ahmed. His lecture was against well-known Islamic scholars of Bangladesh. He is also a student friendly teacher. He never give poor marks to the student. For this reason he was favourite among the students. Now I am talking about some best student of our class. The first boy of our class was Masud Mia. He is very much polite in his behavior. His surname was Himo. He always stands first in our class. Now he is working in an English medium school. His nearest competitor was Jamie. She is now working in Bangladesh police. In my university life I have witnessed many student movements. I witnessed students’ movement for establishing residential hall for the students. Today there are many hall is under construction is the outcome of students’ movement. During this movement police throw tear gas. Once I was about to suffocate due to the tear gas canister thrown by the police to students. There was also movement to reduce the admission fees in Jagannath University. It was a successful movement. As a result of this movement the university authority was compelled to reduce the admission fees. I am also witness of the movement to cancel the article 27(4) which declared Jagannath University as non-residential university. As a result of this movement the government was forced to cancel this article. Many students were injured during all these movements. Near the Jagannath University there is Ahsan Monjil. I with my university friends used to go to Ahsan Monjil to visit. We the friends used to go Bolda Garden which was very near to our university. Shadarghat launch terminal was our place of gossiping though the unpleasant smell of Boriganga River gives us irritating experience. Our modhor canteen was Jagannath University Cafeteria. Here we used to attend the group study. Our university library was big enough and we studied there. Most of the time we do our assignment there. Because the library atmosphere is noise free and calm. The specialty of Jagannath University library is that it is both a manual and a digital library. Our teachers’ student friendly behavior attracts me very much. My classmates was helpful to one another. For example if a classmate is in financial difficulty, we would manage tuition for him. In my university life I had some painful experience as well. Many students fall prey to the students politics. As a result they did not study well and failed in the examination again and again. Many students left the study due to the student’s politics. Another dreadful thing in my university life is ragging. The new students do not have permission to have seat in the university bus. Many new students were physically and mentally harassed by the senior students. In the year 2013 I completed honours and in the year 2015 I have completed masters. I have stayed at the university seven years due to session jam. I have got 2.97 in honours and 3.09 in masters. Thus my glorious university student life has come to an end.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">My Best Friends:</span></strong> I have lots of friends in my life. I will discuss about some of them. My childhood best friends name was Mohammad Sharif. I used to play with him. When he used to eat something special he would give me. I also used to share my best food with him. My other childhood friends name are Mominol, Alamgir monir, Shohrab, Aminol, Shohal etc. They were my playmates. The friend whom I remember most is Sojon. When we are living in Rangpur, I used to play with him. I have made a quarrel with him in the day in which we are leaving Rangpur.. My another childhood best friend’s name is Khokon. When I study in Gondhomoti Madrasah, he was my classmates. I used to play with him. He is the first man who feed me a chewing gum. Before that I never had a chewing gum. In the college I had lots of friend. Tutul, Omar Sharif, Panna, Jahir, Shajib, shohel, Joyal and so on. We play together in Narsingdi Stadium . There was a very big pond in our college campus. In every Friday I with my friends used to bath and swim in the pond. In the university I had lots of friends. Some of them are Mamun, Tina, Irin, Jamie, Masud Mia etc. Among all the friends Mamun was my best friend. I share my happiness and sorrow with him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>My Career:</strong></span> I worked in different organization to earn my livelihood. At first I joined in a school. The name of the school is Tongi Laboratory School, Nishaat Nagar Borodewra, Tongi. Here I worked as an Assistant Teacher in English. My responsibilities are to conduct classes, take examination, prepare question paper for examination and evaluate the answer script. I was in the day shift. After the school hour I had to take coaching classes. I also worked in a publication. The name of the publication is Jupiter Publication. Here I worked for a long time. My responsibilities are to write grammatical items, write paragraph, essays, and article. Proof reading was also one of my prime responsibility. Besides, I worked in a media monitoring agency. The name of the agency was Ryans Archive. It is situated in Kazipara, Mirpur. Here I had to translate news from Bangla to English and vice versa. I had to make synopsis of the news in English.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>My Future Plan:</strong></span> I am looking for the job at present. My future plan is to find out a good job for me. I will earn a lot of money by honest means and through hard working. I will be going to Hajj and Umrah with my future wife. My father and mother also had a dream to go to hajj. I will try to make their dream come true. I have a dream to build a small home of our own so that I along with my family can live peacefully. Finally I have a plan to marry a beautiful and Allah fearing girl in future. Before that I have to prepare and establish myself.</p>
<p>My Idols: I consider three people as idol in my life. They are Prophet Muhammad (SA), Father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Maulana Vashani.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Prophet Muhammad (SA):</strong></span> I consider Prophet Muhammad (SA) as my idol because he is the greatest man of all ages in the earth. Muhammad (SA) the son of &#8216;Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim and his wife Aminah, was born in 570 in the city of Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula. He was a member of the family of Banu Hashim, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Quraysh tribe. It is generally said that &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib named the child &#8220;Muhammad&#8221;. He was a successful politician, a scientist, a warrior who is a specialist in warfare. I follow him as idol because Quran says that Allah created him with good moral character.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman: </span></strong>He is the founding father of the People&#8217;s Republic of Bangladesh. He served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17 April 1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975. He is considered to be the driving force behind the independence of Bangladesh. He became a leading figure in and eventually the leader of the Awami League, founded in 1949 as an East Pakistan-based political party in Pakistan. His 7<sup>th</sup> March lecture still inspired me very much.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani:</strong></span> Maulana Bhashani was an Islamic scholar and political leader in British India (now Bangladesh). His political tenure spanned the British colonial India, Pakistan and Bangladesh periods.Maulana Bhashani is popularly known with the honorary title Mazlum Jananeta (Leader of the Oppressed) for his lifelong stance for the poor suffered by establishment. He gained nationwide mass popularity among peasants and helped to build East Pakistan Peasant Association. Owing to his leaning to the left, often dubbed Islamic Socialism. He is also called &#8216;The Red Maulana&#8217;. Throughout his life he fought for the oppressed people of Bangladesh. His political, social and religious life is a source of inspiration for me.</p>
<p>As a child of middle class family I know the harsh reality of life. Most of my childhood classmates and friends could not cross the circle of class eight. The reason is very simple. The poverty was the main obstacle for them to become educated. Industrialization is also responsible for their illiteracy. Because of industrialization people joined to the industries to earn their livelihood. Some of my childhood friend work in garments industry, some went to abroad, some of them was rickshaw puller, and some of them was businessmen. I am very much thankful to almighty Allah and to my parents for giving me the chance for education</p>
